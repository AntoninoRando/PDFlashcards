# PDFlashcards

A study web app oriented towards flashcards, but with a twist: _flashcards have no back text!_ Instead, each flashcard references one or more pages of a PDF resource, which is a replecament for a text. In this way, there is no need to paste from the study resources in order to create flashcards.
